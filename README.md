## Update schema
If you want to update your API, open your project's amplify/backend/api/<api-name>/schema.graphql file (NOT the one in the amplify/backend/api/<api-name>/build folder) and edit it in your favorite code editor. You can compile the amplify/backend/api/<api-name>/schema.graphql file by running:
`amplify api gql-compile`
